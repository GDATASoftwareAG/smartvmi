    # Required because codacy's conversion tool relativizes paths in respect to the current working directory.
    # Since the project path inside a container is different from the path inside a "raw" worker VM we need to
    # make sure that we match the environment where the clang-tidy output was created (though any container
    # image would do, most likely).
